#What I have learned from this course#
During this course, Iâ€™ve learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage my projects 
and collaborate with others.I now understand how to clone repositories, make 
commits, and push changes. This knowledge will help me work better in teams
and organize my code more effectively in the future.
