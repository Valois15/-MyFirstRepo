 Brief Introduction About Myself
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Valois

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast from Rwanda, focused on using data, programming, and innovation to solve real-world
problems especially in climate resilience, agriculture, and sustainable development.
I enjoy working on collaborative projects, building digital solutions, and learning new tools that make a meaningful impact.

 My skills include HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, teamwork, and problem-solving.
 I'm currently exploring ways to empower African communities through technology and creative solutions.
 Feel free to connect or explore my projects!
